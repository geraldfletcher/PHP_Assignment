The PHP Assignment for my BSc Ordinary Degree in Digital Technologies and Design in Applications Development

Assignment Breif:

Develop a fully object orientated web application.

Your application can preform any relatively complex task that you see fit. For example you might like to build a login system that accepts a users login credentials and validates then against a database record; or perhaps a bus times lookup application that accepts a bus route number and returns the time of the next arriving bus.

Whatever you choose, the app should accept some type of user supplied data and use this to query a database.

The results of that query should vary based on the input supplied by the user, and an appropriate response should then be reported back to the browser.

Remember that you will be sending HTML back to the browser, so you will need to prepare your output before returning it. However the focus of the assignment is PHP and there are no marks going for the HTML output. Just try to make it look as nice as possible, given your current exposure to HTML.

Your application should have the following features:
1. A number of classes spanning several php files, including a database connection class.

2. A mysql database setup script, and accompanying scripts to populate any tables that you require.

3. A basic web form to collect some user input.

4. A method of passing data into your instantiated classes. This code does not need to be fully OO.

5. A selection of functions which accept user supplied data and use this to query your database in some way.

6. One or more functions to report the results of the query back to the user.

Your code should contain highly detailed comments, class headers, etc. explaining each class, method, etc. But there is no need to include any other documentation files.

Marks are awarded for error handling, design considerations and adherence to best practices where possible (eg PEAR PHP style guidelines â€“ or similar - for comments, naming of variables, classes, methods, etc.)
